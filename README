Perambulate is a library for parsing addresses in natural language.

As Seen On TV(tm), Perambulate makes it easier for you to get customer addresses in a normal, conversational form.
No more thousands of input boxes, drop-downs and annoying conversational logic.  Simply ask for their address
and run it through Perambulate.

Usage
=====

    require "perambulate"

    Perambulate.create_address(address_string)


Limitations
===========

At the moment, Perambulate only supports typical Australian addresses.

There is no support for parsing countries.

We do not, and likely will never, do postcode verification.  Since you get the postcode and the suburb back independantly,
it's fairly easy to hook up a postcode verifier once you have the data in hand.
